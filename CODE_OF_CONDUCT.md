# TeslaJS Code of Conduct

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participants within the TeslaJS 
community, as well as steps to reporting unacceptable behavior. We are committed to 
providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all and expect our code of conduct 
to be honored. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be banned from the community.

Our open source community strives to:

* **Be friendly and patient:** Remember you might not be communicating in someone else's 
primary spoken or programming language, and others may not have your level of understanding.

* **Be welcoming:** We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all 
backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, 
ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, immigration status, social and economic 
class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, 
age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.

* **Be considerate:** Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will 
depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, 
and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions. Remember 
that we’re a world-wide community, so you might not be communicating in someone else’s 
primary language.

* **Be respectful:** Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no 
excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. Disrespectful and unacceptable behavior includes, 
but is not limited to:
    * Violent threats or language.
    * Discriminatory or derogatory jokes and language.
    * Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
    * Posting, or threatening to post, people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
    * Insults, especially those using discriminatory terms or slurs.
    * Behavior that could be perceived as sexual attention.
    * Advocating for or encouraging any of the above behaviors.

* **Be careful in the words that we choose:** we are a community of professionals, 
and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put 
down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren’t 
acceptable.

* **Try to understand why we disagree:** Disagreements, both social and 
technical, happen all the time. It is important that we resolve disagreements 
and differing views constructively. Remember that we’re different. The 
strength of our community comes from its diversity, people from a wide 
range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. 
Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that 
they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming each other 
doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and 
learning from mistakes.
